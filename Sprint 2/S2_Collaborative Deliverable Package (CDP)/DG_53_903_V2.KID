The Bad Address Indicator field applies to the address at which the patient

"^DD",2,2,.121,21,3,0)
 
"^DD",2,2,.121,21,4,0)
    "UNDELIVERABLE" - Bad Address based on returned mail.

    "HOMELESS" - Patient is known to be homeless.

    "OTHER" - Other Bad Address Reason
"^DD",2,2,.121,21,7,0)

"^DIC",2,2,"%D",3,0)

requesting to receive care as a VETERAN of the U.S. Armed Forces and
